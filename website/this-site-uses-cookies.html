        <p>Despite their benefits, cookies can pose risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy Invasion:</strong> Third-party cookies can track your activity across sites, creating a detailed profile without your consent. <em>Example: <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/basic-page/618/how-we-use-and-protect-your-data" target="_blank">Reports indicate</a> that some cookies are programmed to follow you around the web, collecting information from your online behavior that’s used to build a detailed profile. This profile can reveal details such as whether you're a child, adult, engaged, or have children, where you live, your hobbies, job role, financial status, daily routines, entertainment choices, favorite brands, recent online searches, health concerns and political or social interests.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Targeted Advertising:</strong> Advertisers can use the data to display personalized ads based on your browsing history, potentially leading to a feeling of being constantly watched.</li>
        </ul>
            <table>
                <caption>How Your Online Searches Influence the Ads You See</caption>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Cookies can sometimes be exploited to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.  <em>Example: Attackers can steal cookies from your device, move them to their laptop, and use them to log into your account from their own device, gaining access to your personal information.</em></li>

        <!-- Legal Obligations Section -->
        <h2>Legal Obligations for Website Owners</h2>
        <p>
            Website owners must inform users about cookies and obtain their consent before placing cookies on their devices. This is crucial under laws like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/" target="_blank">GDPR in the EU</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">CCPA in the USA.</a> Here’s how to ensure compliance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implement a Cookie Banner:</strong> Display a banner informing users of cookie use and seeking their consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Your Privacy Policy:</strong> Clearly state the types of cookies used, what data they collect, and how it’s used. Provide options to manage cookie preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Cookie Management:</strong> Allow users to accept, reject, or customize cookie preferences and withdraw consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Cookies on Kolodych.com Section -->
        <h3>Cookies on Kolodych.com: What You Need to Know</h3>
        
        <p>After integrating <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</a> and <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/google-analytics">Microsoft Clarity</a> into <a href="https://kolodych.com/">my website</a>, I noticed an increase in the variety and number of cookies being set. These tools automatically add cookies that track user behavior and engagement across the site. Google Tag Manager helps manage and deploy various marketing and analytics tags, leading to the creation of cookies that track user interactions for analytics and advertising purposes. Similarly, Microsoft Clarity sets cookies that collect data on user sessions, including clicks, scrolls, and page views, to provide insights into how users interact with the site. <em>For example, here is example of Microsoft Clarity feature to record user sessions, that could help website owners understand how people interact with their website:</em>
