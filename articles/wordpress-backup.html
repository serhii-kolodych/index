      <h1>Your WordPress site will fail. Be ready.</h1>

      <p><em>Published on December 14, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        How to stop worrying about your WordPress site failing and start
        implementing new features.
      </p>

      <h2>Website crashes are normal</h2>

      <p>
        Updates fail. Plugins conflict. Servers go down. Themes break layouts.
        Hackers exploit weak spots. You do not control when this happens. You
        control how fast you recover. Most site owners panic. They search logs.
        They contact hosting. They wait. Hours pass. Sometimes days. Without
        backups, recovery becomes guesswork. A backup removes fear. It turns a
        crash into a routine task. Restore. Check. Move on.
      </p>

      <h3>A WordPress Backup plugin is the solution</h3>

      <p>
        While there are many backup plugins available, not all are created
        equal. Some are lightweight and reliable, while others can slow down
        your site or cause conflicts. Choosing the right plugin is crucial for
        effective backup management and peace of mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've tried all of them:
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a>,
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/backuply/">Backuply</a>,
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>,
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/">BackWPup</a>,
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpvivid-backuprestore/"
          >WPvivid</a
        >, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/">Duplicator</a>,
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/"
          >All-in-One WP Migration</a
        >. And after 20+ website restorations, I can confidently say that
        <strong
          ><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpvivid-backuprestore/"
            >WPvivid</a
          ></strong
        >
        is the best option for most users. It strikes the perfect balance
        between comprehensive protection and ease of use, without the complexity
        that makes you need a computer science degree to configure it properly.
      </p>

      <h4>What WPvivid Can Do For You</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Full website backups.</li>
        <li>Database-only backups.</li>

        <li>Manual backups on demand.</li>
        <li>Automatic scheduled backups.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Backup splitting for large sites.</li>
        <li>Incremental backups in Pro version.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Your First Backup with WPvivid</h4>
      <p>
        Despite all of WPvivid's capabilities, you need to verify that it works
        correctly for YOUR specific setup. Every website is unique — different
        themes, plugins, hosting environments, and configurations.
        <strong>Backups mean nothing if restore fails.</strong> Never trust
        blindly — test once, then relax.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Install and activate WPvivid plugin.</li>
        <li>Open WPvivid Backup in WordPress, tab "Backup & Restore".</li>
        <img
          src="wpvivid-backup.webp"
          alt="WPvivid Backup Interface"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
        />
        <li>Choose "Database + Files".</li>
        <li>Choose "Save to Local".</li>
        <li>Click "Backup Now".</li>
        <li>Wait for the backup to complete.</li>
        <li>
          Reload the page, click the button "Scan uploaded backup or received
          backup", then click "Download".
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Congratulations! You have successfully created your first backup. Now
        it's time to test the restore process.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create a blank test WordPress site.</li>
        <li>Install and activate WPvivid plugin on a Test site.</li>
        <li>In the test site, open WPvivid, tab "Backup & Restore".</li>
        <li>
          Scroll down below the "Backup Now" button to find the "Upload"
          section, then click 'Upload'" and select the backup file from your
          local machine. Wait for the message "The upload has completed." -
          click "OK".
        </li>
        <li>
          Now click the "Backups" button (located next to the 'Upload' button).
        </li>
        <li>
          There you should see the uploaded backup and click "Restore" and then
          again "Restore" and click "OK".
        </li>
        <img
          src="wpvivid-restore.webp"
          alt="WPvivid Restore Process"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
        />
        <li>
          Don't close or switch to other tabs during the restore process. When
          finished you will get message "Restore completed successfully." -
          click "OK".
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Perfect! You just successfully completed a full backup and restore test.
        Reload the page, go to different pages and sections of your website to
        confirm everything is working as expected. This confirms that your
        backups are not only created but also restorable.
      </p>

      <p>
        This entire test process takes 5-60 minutes (depending on the size of
        your site) and is worth every second. I test my backups every couple of
        months, and there have been times, when:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>File corrupted during transfer.</li>
        <li>PHP timeout during restore.</li>
        <li>Incompatible plugin files.</li>
        <li>Invalid backup file format.</li>
        <li>and so much more things that can go wrong...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That's why for every website I have / make - I create a test website to
        verify the backup works. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://bubacatcity.com/">Bubacatcity.com</a> has a copy on a
          <a href="https://lightsalmon-salamander-914319.hostingersite.com/"
            >test server</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://vent-build.com">Vent Build website</a> has a copy on
          a
          <a href="https://gray-stork-635160.hostingersite.com/">test server</a>
        </li>
        <li>and you can be sure, that all other websites as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This practice gives me peace of mind and ensures that my clients'
        websites are always protected and recoverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this backup and restore process using WPvivid worked out well for
        your website - I can share with you my settings and best practices for
        even smoother and more reliable backups.

      />
      <p>
        I hope you now understand the importance of having your backups not in
        the same place as your website. To do this - go to tab "Remote Storage"
        - click on the Cloud service you like the most and then "Authenticate"
        (log in to your account). After that give it descriptive name, so later
        you'll know where to find your backups.
      </p>

        src="wpvivid-remote-storage.webp"
        alt="WPvivid Add Remote Storage "
        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
      />

      <p>
        Then go to tab "Schedule", tick "Enable backup schedule", choose how
        often to do backups (e.g., daily or weekly), choose "Database + Files"
        and "Send backups to remote storage" (in my case Google Drive icon is
        active, since I authenticated it in "Remote Storage" tab before). And
        most importantly click "Save".
      </p>

      <img
        src="wpvivid-schedule.webp"
        alt="WPvivid Schedule Settings"
        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
      />

      <p>
        One last step is to go to tab "Settings" -> "General settings" and
        choose the maximum allowed amount of backups retained = 7. Then I
        recommend to tick "Merge all the backup files into single" and click
        "Save". All the rest settings are not that important.
      </p>

      />
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Three years ago, I lost two weeks of work because I trusted backups I
        never tested. The panic, the scrambling, the realization that my "backup
        solution" was just an empty promise—I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I'm so insistent about testing. That's why I have test
        websites for every client site I manage. That's why I check my backup
        logs monthly and run quarterly restore tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not because I'm paranoid. Because I learned the hard way that hope is
        not a backup strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You just invested an hour setting this up properly. Testing.
        Configuring. Connecting remote storage. That hour is worth years of
        peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had servers crash. Hard drives fail. Hosting accounts suspended due
        to billing errors. Security breaches that required immediate rollback.
        Plugin updates that broke entire sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every single time, I restored from backup and was back online within 20
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        My clients never knew there was a problem. My visitors never saw
        downtime. I never lost sleep or spent hours on emergency support calls.
      </p>
      <p>That's what you just set up for yourself.</p>
      <p>
        The next time something breaks — and something will break — you'll
        remember this article. You'll go to WPvivid. You'll click restore. And
        15 minutes later, you'll be back to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the small group of website owners who actually sleep well at
        night.
      </p>

        <strong
          >If You Remember Nothing Else From This Article, Remember
          This:</strong
        >
        Every update — every single one — should happen on a test environment
        first. Not sometimes. Not for "small" updates. Every. Single. Time.
